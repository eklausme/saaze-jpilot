Web-site has been redesigned again.

Major changes:
* _All_ files are now Markdown ([CommonMark](https://commonmark.org)) files with Yaml-frontmatter, therefore all files run through the same template and so have the same layout. Luckily, Markdown accepts HTML code, so most pages still contain lots of original HTML code.
* Removed duplicates
* Removed dead links
* Dropped separate screenshot page as images are contained in manuals
* Previous feature page is now landing page
* Henrik Becker's German manual is now a single file, German umlaute are corrected
* Menu slimmed down, using sub-menus
* Jekyll is no longer used as static site generator, but _Simplified Saaze_ is used instead
* A couple of minor corrections in spelling
* Positioning is relative, i.e., whole web-presence can be moved easily
* Removed all JavaScript and web-fonts thereby reducing storage by 500kB for _each_ page having "social icons"

Converting all pages is quick:
```bash
$ time php saaze

        execute(): filePath=/home/klm/tmp/jpilotweb/content/pages.yml, nentries=0, totalPages=0, entries_per_page=30
