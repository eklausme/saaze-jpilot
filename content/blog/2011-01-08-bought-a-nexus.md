title: Bought A Nexus, My First Android Device

I bought a Nexus One about a year ago in the hopes of replacing my Palm with something better. Now a year later it still doesnâ€™t come close to replacing the functionality of my Treo 680.

My long term goal is to build an Android sync conduit for Contacts and Calendar and write a Tasks, Memos, and Keyring app with sync conduits.

With this goal in mind I completed my first Android application [J-Calc](https://flippedbits.com/jcalc).
